### read in the list of file names and add a header
```{r}
rcds<- read.csv("fileList.csv", header = FALSE)
nrow(rcds)
#(correct nrow = 2498)
colnames(rcds) <- c("filename")
head(rcds)
```

### splitting the different segments in the file name into columns because they provide info about the recording

```{r}
read.table(text = as.character(prod$filename), sep = "_")
```
